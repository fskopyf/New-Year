            <p style="text-align:center;">According to scientists, the tradition of celebrating the New Year originated in Ancient Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago. The Babylonians began the New Year with the month of Nissan (coinciding with the vernal equinox) and was established in honor of the supreme god Marduk (the patron god of the city of Babylon). Then this festive tradition was adopted by the Greeks and Egyptians, then it passed to the Romans.</p>
